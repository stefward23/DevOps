### Process:

1. We continued using our Flask test application directory.
2. We created a templates subdirectory in our flasker app directory..
3. We created a home.html file.

4. Resources we used to guide us in constructing an HTML form: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp and https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/

 Example HTML:

6. We configured app.route("/"), which contains a function to render the home.html file. We also created a utc_dt variable to display the date and time, along with a variable stored in the __init__.py file.
