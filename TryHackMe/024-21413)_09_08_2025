# Moniker Link (CVE-2024-21413)

## Time: 1.30 Hr

Leak user's credentials using CVE-2024-21413 to bypass Outlook's Protected View.

Tools used: responder 

What Responder does

Listens for broadcast name resolution requests:

LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution)

NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service)

mDNS (Multicast DNS)

When a Windows machine cannot resolve a hostname via DNS, it may fall back to LLMNR/NBT-NS.

Responder spoofs the reply, making the victim believe the attacker is the correct host.

The victim then tries to authenticate (e.g., SMB, HTTP) â†’ sending NTLMv1/v2 hashes to Responder.

Pentesters can capture these hashes and later crack them offline or relay them to other services (NTLM relay attacks).

ðŸ”¹ Common Use Cases

Hash harvesting â†’ Collect NTLM credentials for offline cracking.

SMB/HTTP relay attacks â†’ Use captured credentials to authenticate to other systems without cracking them.

Network visibility â†’ See which systems are making name resolution broadcasts.

ðŸ”¹ Example usage
sudo responder -I eth0


-I eth0 â†’ listens on interface eth0.

Captured hashes are usually saved in /usr/share/responder/logs/.
